    <h1> About Me</h1> <p>My name is Mohammed Saad Ansari, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Information Systems at Trine University.
I began my academic journey with a Diploma in Computer Engineering, which gave me a strong technical foundation. Later, I pursued a Bachelor’s in Information Technology, where I deepened my knowledge in software development and networking. Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems at Trine University, USA. Alongside academics, I have gained hands-on experience in web development and cybersecurity. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.I have completed internships in web development, where I designed and maintained responsive, user-friendly applications.
These experiences strengthened my skills in front-end and back-end development, as well as database management.
Beyond development, I have a growing interest in cybersecurity and its role in protecting systems and data.
I am currently enhancing my knowledge of network security, ethical practices, and risk management.
My goal is to combine technical development skills with a strong understanding of security principles.
I am passionate about building digital solutions that are not only innovative but also secure and reliable.
Continuous learning drives me, and I actively seek opportunities to expand my expertise.
I enjoy working in collaborative environments where I can share ideas and learn from others.
With my blend of web development experience and cybersecurity focus, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.</p>
